This project generates AI images from text prompts using Stable Diffusion and Hugging Face’s diffusers library. It lets users enter a description and filename via a simple HTML interface, creates the image with text overlay, supports GPU acceleration, and saves the result automatically.
This project uses Stable Diffusion from Hugging Face’s diffusers library to generate AI images from text descriptions. It allows users to provide an image description and file name through a simple HTML and CSS interface, then automatically generates the image, adds the description as a text overlay, and saves the final result. The code integrates with Hugging Face authentication, supports GPU acceleration for faster image generation, and ensures clean output handling. With this setup, you can quickly create customized AI-generated images, store them locally or in your preferred storage, and display them directly within the application.
